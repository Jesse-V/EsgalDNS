.SH "NAME"
.sp
The Onion Name System (OnioNS) \- Tor-powered Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden
Services \- Server Edition

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
onions-server\fR [\fB--help\fR|\fB--license\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Tor is a third-generation onion router that acts as anonymizing communication
service. Users choose a path through a set of three Tor nodes and negotiate a
"virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor
and successor, but no others. Tor also supports hidden services: anonymous
servers that intentionally hide their IP address through Tor circuits.
Traditionally, hidden services have major usability issues because their
addresses are algorithmically generated. OnioNS allows clients to access hidden
services by a meaningful, globally-unique domain name chosen by the hidden
service operator.
.sp
This package provides the networking and data processing functionality for
OnioNS servers.
