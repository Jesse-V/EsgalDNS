.SH NAME
OnioNS \- Tor-powered Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden Services

.SH SYNOPSIS
    \OnioNS\fR [\fB--help\fR|\fB--license\fR|\fB--version\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Tor a third-generation onion router that acts as anonymizing communication service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node.

Tor also supports hidden services, anonymous servers that intentionally hide their IP address through Tor circuits. Hidden services are traditionally contacted by an .onion domain name, an algorithmically-generated address. This introduces severe usability problems because of the disassiation between a service's purpose and its domain name. OnioNS is a Tor-powered distributed DNS that associates human-meaningful .tor domains with .onion hidden service addresses.
