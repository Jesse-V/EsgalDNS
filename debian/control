Description: Tor-powered distributed DNS for Tor hidden services.
 The Onion Name System (OnioNS) is a privacy-enhanced distributed DNS for Tor
 hidden services. It provides a mapping between .tor domains and .onion hidden
 service addresses. OnioNS enables hidden service operators to claim a unique
 meaningful domain name for their service, which clients can then easily use to
 access the hidden service.

 This package provides client, server, and hidden
 service protocols and is intended to be installed and used alongside Tor.
