{"name":"EsgalDNS","tagline":"EsgalDNS (alpha) - Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden Services","body":"### EsgalDNS (alpha) - Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden Services\r\n\r\nA distributed, Tor-powered, and fully confirmable DNS system for Tor hidden services. The goal of this project is to associate **.tor** domain names with existing **.onion** addresses. This will significantly increase the usability and accessibility of Tor hidden services. The project avoids any central authority overseeing the system and is built with security, privacy, and anonymity in mind.\r\n\r\nThis is still under development and is nowhere near ready for deployment. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n@Jesse-V (me) is the primary author, under the guidance of Dr. Ming Li, Dr. Flann, and Dr. Watson of the CS Department at Utah State University.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nSend me an email if you have any questions or need help with this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
