### Installation

    Coming soon!

* **Install from source**

> 1. **sudo apt-get install botan1.10-dev g++ cmake build-essential**
> 2. **./compileRun.sh**

    I use ./ClangCompileRun.sh for development because I prefer the [Clang compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang). Most everyone has GCC, so ./compileRun.sh works for them. If you want to use Clang, use the Clang script.
